      <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>With an interest in computing for scientific discovery, I've found my way into numerous scientifically relevant projects and jobs over the years.</p> 
        <p>I started early in the field of grid computing, becoming involved in the National Science Foundation (NSF) TeraGrid project at Indiana University. I also worked in various capacities for additional scientific projects, including at Exxon Mobil Research Center. After joining NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I've since become involved with many more scientific and space-centric projects, some of which are detailed below. I've also become an active developer for the Apache Software Foundation as well as a project management committee member. Complementing my career work, I am pursuing a graduate degree at the University of Southern California, Viterbi School of Engineering.</p>
        <p>My current area of interest is in large scale data management systems aiding in scientific pursuits. This field is colloquially known as Big Data management and analytics.</p>
